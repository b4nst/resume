  summary: >
    Staff engineer who spends way too much time making computers talk to each other so I don't have to.
    Currently obsessed with systems programming and making packets go brrr across networks (see: building a global mesh network for satellites, because why not?).
    When I'm not automating myself out of a job, you'll find me hacking on low-level network stuff or getting my hands dirty building bicycles.
    My philosophy: if it's not simple, it's not done. Also, if it can be automated, it will be automated - I'm too lazy for manual work!
